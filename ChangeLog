ChangeLog for remem:
2.12 - 09/21/01 - Made a few changes so Savant will compile on OS-X. First, removed the include of malloc.h
	          in dateyacc.c, since OS-X has trouble finding it and we don't seem to need it anyway.
		  Second, added /sw/include to configure.in and /sw/lib to main/Makefile.am so OS-X can
		  find the PCRE libraries when they were installed using Fink. At least the Makefile change
		  should be moved into configure.in before releasing. Also, I ran the following command:
		  "cd remem-2.12; automake --add-missing -c; autoreconf" to update the "missing" script to
		  a later version. Not yet sure if I want to include the missing files myself or just
		  include that command in the installation directions.
2.11 - 08/06/01 - Changed parse-text so it indexes words with more than one punctuation mark after them
                  (e.g. "doh!!!" or "really?!?" or "hmm..."). Removed pcre from the source distribution.
                  I was including 1.09 and it's up to 3.4 now, plus the library is often included in
                  other distributions (e.g. kdesupport). This distribution should include documentation
                  saying where to get the pcre libraries, and include pointers to RPMS. Updated the 
                  email_body_filter_regexps filter to only look at the first 100 lines of a header. This 
                  sanity check keeps pcre from blowing up if, say, you're given an email body with 
                  thousands of lines of code all indented so it thinks it's all one header. Moved 
                  this text to ChangeLog and out of savant.h. Updated the man pages. Removed the code
		  in rmain.c that changed relative pathnames to absolute pathnames, 'cause it upsets
		  Windows (and doesn't seem necessary for Unix).
2.10 - 04/26/01 - changed delimiter of RMAIL from "^_^L" to "(^|\n)^_^L" to fix a potential parse
                  error (it's just more correct, mainly). Also redid parsedoc.c's find_next_doc to
                  not re-search the entire file for a delimiter after it's not found in the first pass
                  (should speed up indexing a little for long documents, e.g. ones with attachments). It
                  also includes a fix for an off-by-one error that made find_next_doc occationally produce
                  one-character-long documents. In remem.el, Fixed clobbering of C-xo bug that I introduced 
                  in 2.09, plus fixed remem-query-extra-string-previous bug (should be 
                  remem-query-extra-text-string-previous)
2.09 - 01/18/01 - Moved HTML template to before Unix Mail. Unix Mail is just too easy to get
                  a false positive. Added a different Jimminy-query-mode template for the
                  new jimminy. Made it so setting biases doesn't print in non-verbose mode.
                  Added vm-mode to the emacs rmail query mode stuff.
                  Got rid of values.h from dateyacc.c, which was upsetting BSD.
2.08 - 02/18/00 - Included Webra template, logging of doc & query types in remem.el, plus a new
                  normalization based on query length (now normalize by number of unique words,
                  not number of words total). The former tended to penalize longer queries.
                  This is still a tricky issue, but this one at least seems a little bit fairer.
                  Also fixed (I hope) the unix mail to include the first message of the archive.
                  Remem.el now defaults to printing hash marks for how relevant a hit is, rather 
                  than the numbers. Also can set it to not show hits below a certain threshold.
                  Also added the remem-mode-db-alist change database based on major mode.
2.07 - 09/23/99 - Included official signature-line filter ("\n-- \n"), Added "follow symbolic links" option.
                  More remem.el work, including looking at "RMAIL" buffer when in "RMAIL-summary" buffer, and
                  same for VM.
2.06 - 09/02/99 - load doc template info all at the beginning to avoid multiple disk
                  seeks while filling the cache.  Saves a lot of time when going
                  over NFS (though we're still about twice as slow as from local disk)
                  Lots of remem.el work.
2.05 - 07/19/99 - Added output of template type, output of filename
2.04 - 06/16/99 - Changed all_sims and total_sims to use a hash table instead of an array.
                  This saves buckos of memory in ra-retrieve (like it's probably less than 
                  half now on average).  Also added C-cf, the field query.
2.03 - 05/25/99 - Added some sanity checks to remem.el so it gives clear error messages when
                  the config is wrong.  Also added a sanity check so if a single document goes 
                  more than 100K we assume we goofed and truncate (don't index) the rest of the
                  file.
2.02 - 04/12/99 - Added logging to remem.el, added man pages for ra-index and ra-retrieve, 
                  and got rid of having a period on a line by itself delimit a query, since
                  that can be a part of a query.  (Now you have to use ^D).
                  Also now works on the Alpha (64-bit clean), and fixed a few other minor bugs.
2.01 - 02/10/99 - Mainly changes to remem.el -- a few minor bug fixes, plus lots of changes
                  to have it work for XEmacs.  Also got rid of (require 'jimminy), which was
                  neither released with this version nor used by it.
2.00 - 02/26/99 - Release 2.0, which is a major rewrite of almost all aspects of the code.
                  Includes generalized templates using perl regular expressions, generalized
                  addition of new field-types, and function pointers for new data types so you
                  can add new distance metrics (e.g. for GPS coordinates), with potential for 
                  code reuse.  The text retrieval now uses the Okapi TF/iDF algorithm from City
                  University, and has a completely different database format that is about 40% 
                  the size of the old system.  The emacs front-end is also rewritten, with mouse
                  support and more customization.  It also sends major-mode information to Savant,
                  so the back-end can be more clever about parsing a query (e.g. by pulling out
                  the from-line in email being written).
1.44 - 09/02/98 - Added filename to the subject title line in full query
1.43r- 04/17/98 - Fixed up some header stuff left over from the yenta merge, and a bug where
                  decode_char didn't handle numbers correctly.
                  (Note: the "r" is rhodes -- merge this comment with the other 1.43 branches 
                  when checking in, and remember to update the VERSION, above).
     - 06/20/98 - Added keywords to the full query, event added better error handling, and malex
                  changed the indexer to process and index in a single step instead of two batch jobs.
                  (Version number changes are less often now that we're using CVS.)
1.42 - 04/03/98 - fullquery now includes a breakdown of how much a field contributes to the
                  similarity as a whole.
1.41 - 04/02/98 - Fixed make_nice_date so won't coredump on Euro-format dates (mm/dd/yy)
1.40 - 03/29/98 - Adds the "fullquery" commmand, which gives lots of information 
                  as a query result, instead of just the nicely formatted, human 
                  readable stuff.  Also fixed ra-index so not having a "-v" still 
                  works. Finally, the template system now only recognizes a file 
                  as a certain type if the "recognize" field appears in the 
                  first 500 characters (#define'ed in template.h).  This
                  keeps ra-index from thinking a text file is plain email,
                  just because it has "From " at the start of a line somewhere.
1.39r- 03/19/98 - Fixed lots of problems with date & time indexing and lookup
1.38 - 03/16/98 - Re-fixed a problem with retrieval, an array bounds overread
                  in wordvec/readwv_ra.c.  
1.37 - 03/13/98 - Cleaned up build system again.
1.36 - 03/13/98 - Completely reconciled versions of index, retrieve and merge.
                  This actually fixes some weird memory corruption bugs carried 
		     over from 1.34 as well.
1.35 - 02/19/98 - A semi-broken interim version; after the big merge stemming
                  from v. 1.34, we had to go through and fix all the 
		     brokenness and inconsistency.  The biggest problem was
		     in wordvec, which had to be custom-modified to satisfy 
		     some needs of Yenta.  Much of the directory structure was
		     also rearranged.  v. 1.35 features a mostly bug-free indexer
		     and a mostly broken retriever.  The code was frozen at this
		     point to allow people to play with the indexer.
1.34 - 01/??/98 - Fixed merge_dvmags() so that auto-split-and-merge actually 
                  works correctly;  also uncommented code to remove temp subdirs.
                  For the record, this is the version from which the RA-Yenta 
                  merge was propagated.
1.33	- 01/21/98 - Separated merge.c into mmain.c and merge.c, patched merge.c 
                  routines into index.c to effect automatic split-and-merge
1.32 - 01/20/98 - Standardized types in database (DB_INT, etc.);
                  Replaced calls to fwrite/fread with fwrite_big/fread_big,
		     so that databases are in big-endian byte order;
		     Fixed many warnings, a few memory leaks.
		     Incorporated rhodes' div-by-0 bug fix in readwv.c
		     Added -d command line option
1.31 - 01/15/98 - Made to work with GNU autoconf, courtesy of amu
1.30 - 01/13/98 - Code base for anticipated 2.0 release
                  Includes new parsedate package, addition of "delimiter" field
		     to templates, all the new field-type tags added for ISWC/DL,
		     etc...
1.25 - 06/06/97 - Intermediate version; a merge of 1.22 and 1.23.
       12/29/97 - Uses TFiDF instead of just term frequency.
1.23 - 06/04/97 - Not actually a descendent of 1.22 but a sibling; never released.
                  Several small bugfixes - memory leaks, array bounds violations,
                  etc.  Fixed a some serious bugs in splitting documents by 
		     template and in the use of window maps during retrieval.
		     Also added new "index_dotfiles" config variable and added new 
		     "Reject" keyword to templates.  Also contains many preparations
		     for the grafting-on of a latent-semantic indexing module to 
		     replace wordvec.
1.22 - 06/03/97 - Memory leak in writing database fixed, for a significant
                  speedup.  Brad added new "location" field to templates, as
		     well as modifying the indexing to make use of fields other
		     than "body" and "title" and modifying retrieval with options
		     for different normalization schemes
1.2  - 03/16/97 - Separated savant into index and retrieve; widespread
                  modularization of internals; new eigentext work begun
1.1  - 10/26/96 - Fixed two bugs: in common.c, fixed by_alpha() to actually
                  sort strings correctly, as opposed to randomly mixing 
		     them up, and in inter.c, fixed update_matches() to not
		     try to read index -1 of matches.
1.0 - 07/29/96 - First "mostly stable" public release
