This directory contains source to the parsedate library included in the
'xjot' source code.  Some of the source files have been modified to eliminate
warnings when compiling with 'gcc -Wall'.  In addition, dateyacc.y was modified
to accept a few more variations on timezone specification.  The original source
files have been included with the suffix '.orig'.
