Current Version: 2.11
See the file ChangeLog for the details of all changes

Major changes from 2.10 to 2.11
* Removed pcre from the source distribution, so it won't conflict if users
  already have it installed. The minor downside is users now need to
  install it.
* ra-index now indexes words with more than one punctuation mark after them
  (e.g. "doh!!!" or "really?!?" or "hmm...").
* Added files that GNU automake wants to see, like ChangeLog, NEWS, INSTALL
  and AUTHORS

For major changes before 2.11, see ChangeLog
